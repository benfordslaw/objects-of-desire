# objects-of-desire
Giant list of things that are wanted, according to authors in project gutenberg born after 1900

Created using Allison Parrish's [Gutenberg, dammit](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit) and python and [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) to:

1. Get a single string of all the text from Project Gutenberg written by authors born after 1900
2. Delete the sentences that don't have anything to do with love or desire or longing
3. Get the direct object out of every clause in which the verb has something to do with love or desire or longing
4. Put those direct objects into a text file

This resulted in 18,336 things that are wanted.
